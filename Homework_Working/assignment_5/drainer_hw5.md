1. Forecast Summary--My forecast this week is going off of an average of the last two week's observed data. I am still clueless on how to forecast streamflow, but based on the max, median, and mean of the last two and four weeks, I elected to go with something a little closer to the mean, maybe a little lower. No rain is still expected near the site for the  next several days. The average for the last two weeks was about 84 cfs, and 87 for the last four weeks. Max values were 111 and 157 for those same time periods, respectively. I think it's safer to go with something close to the mean, but a little lower due to the absence of any new precipitation. We'll go with 80 for the first week, and 85 for the two week forecasts.
