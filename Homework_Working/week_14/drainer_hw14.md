1. My favorite and most useful topics were plotting with matplotlib and xarray, and learning how to load/read in data from different sources. Those seem to be the most applicable python tools for atmospheric science and hydrology applications. 
   
2. With my limited knowledge of python, I just don't know what I don't know. If anything, I would say more complex mapping, computation, or statistical analysis. Some specific atmospheric science, hydrology, or meteorology packages could be introduced--I'm thinking something like MetPy or SharpPy (more ATMO-focused, I think).
   
3. I am very happy with how far I've come with python and using applying it, as I knew almost nothing when I started. It has been very useful, especially with a project I have in another class that requires computing terms of governing equations and performing scale analysis.
   
4. The only thing I can think of to maybe make this a better class is to provide a list of the topics at the beginning of the semester with a caveat that we may not get to all of them, but the students will have an idea up front of what will be covered. Then, maybe have a list of other common things that might be more complex in python that would be useful to know (like I don't know what else to put for #3), that way students could have an idea of what is being used by others, even if we don't get to that topic in class. Then students could ask questions after trying to learn those things on their own. If the class goes really fast, then we might even get to some of those more advanced/complex topics. Overall this class was a great intro course for python, and I'm really glad I decided to take it. Thanks so much!
