1. Forecast Summary: I'm still calculating my forecasts based on the difference between the weekly average and monthly average and adding it to the most recent observed flow. This week, I updated the percentages I used in my forecast based on the fact that I have been consistently low over the past few weeks. My week 1 forecast for 2023-12-04 is  201 cfs and my week 2 forecast for 2023-12-11 is  209 cfs.

2. Reflections: I really like the Copilot tool in VS code. It helps to quickly fix or format something, and I used it to help with a label that is written based on a variable input--the label text will use a variable input, such as a date, when it's printed. I also figured out how to use datetime to calculate differences between dates using timedelta. Those were the two new functions I created--one to add days to a date, another to subtract days from a date. This was handy when trying to change my code for a single forecast date variable input.
