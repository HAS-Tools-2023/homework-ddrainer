Homework Assignment 1

For this assignment, I utilized some fancy tools in Excel to try and figure this out. I don't know much about streamflow forecasting, but a quick look at the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) from the USDA reveals that much of the process involves statistical modeling. So, I did a couple of different things: I plotted all of the data I pulled from the USGS for the Verde River at Camp Verde and broke it out by each August for all years individually from 1989 to 2023. This revealed most of the streamflow remained below 1000 cfs, with the exception of what appears to be extreme rainfall events (considering there's not much snow left to melt in August); the biggest of which appears to be around 22-23 Aug 1992, when there appeared to be a strong frontal system push through the Southwest. Since utilizing all of this data was probably not the best way to make a forecast considering at least the changes in the climatological averages, I decided to just go back and look at the last 5 years of streamflow. Then I used the Excel forecast function to plot out values through Sep 2023. Looking back at the last couple of days, it was about 5 cfs too high, so I adjusted. So, just a wild guess with some funny math, but there it is. I also took into account that the 8â€“14-day CPC probability of precipitation over AZ is leaning towards a slightly below average chance of getting normal precip amounts.
