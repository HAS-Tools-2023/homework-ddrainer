Homework Assignment 2

### Grade
3/3 nice work

I went back and compared the previous week's observed streamflow with the forecast from Excel from last week, and not surprisingly they are much lower that what was forecast. Keeping in mind that it looks like much drier air will set in over Arizona for the next couple of weeks with little monsoon activity, I'll keep the streamflow forecast to a minimum--near the values of the previous week. Adjusting values from the previous Excel numbers seem to be more realistic than running new numbers, as those came up negative--and it doesn't make sense to have negative streamflow. Those numbers are still slightly increasing, so I adjusted based on the fact there is no rain in sight.
